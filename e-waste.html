                    <ol>
                        <li class="abc">The waste collected from the city is brought to the plant in specially designed transportation vehicles , which are initially weighed in a weigh bridge located at the the entrance of the plant.</li>
                        <li class="abc">The waste is then dumped in the tipping floor at the outer periphery of the plant , where large items like wood, etc., are separated.</li>
                        <li class="abc">The remaining waste is then heaped in windrows (large rows of approximately 3 meter width and 2 meter height and the length. </li>
                        <li class="abc">There will be seven rows, each row for each day of the week. These rows are turned every week for 4 weeks</li>
                        <li class="abc">As time passes, the size of the rows gets reduced due to decomposition of the waste and the resultant volume reduction. </li>
                        <li class="abc">Hence the number of final rows will be less than the number of initial rows. This period , known as maturation period completes in 28 days, after which the waste undergoes mechanical processing operation.</li>
                        <li class="abc">The mechanical processing is sieving at three stages, where inorganic items not suited for composting are separated and the organic fraction converted as compost. </li>
                        <li class="abc">Sieving at each stage is done employing differential sieves, reducing the mesh size at each stage, i.e the first stage sieve employs 36mm mesh, the second stage of sieving are either reused or disposed of at the landfill.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li class="abc">Have maximum of 2 meter height, and it can be as long as the site allows.</li>
                        <li class="abc">As windrow diminishes in size as it degrades, two windrows can be combined as one and this is particularly useful in winter to retain heat, and it also provides more space for further operations.</li>
                        <li class="abc">At the outer periphery of the plant, seven windrow will be formed one for each day, i.e., one heap for Sunday, one for Monday, so that seven waste heaps will be there at the periphery of the plant, seven windrows will be formed one for each day,  one for Monday and so on, so that seven waste heaps will be there at the periphery at the end of the week.</li>
                        <li class="abc">After seven days the waste which came first is turned and placed in next position in the inner side in order to get space for fresh waste to heap in the outer periphery. </li>
                        <li class="abc"> The same will be adopted for the remaining six day’s waste. After 14 days the waste at second position is turned and placed at third position simultaneous with the waste at first position to second position to provide space for fesh waste as shoen . this process is continued for 4 weeks. (28 days) </li>

Coal fly ash contains about 70 % of aluminium and silica in the form of Al2O3 and SiO2 which acts as a catalyst by providing a large surface area on which the waste plastic molecules can sit and so be exposed to high temperature inside the reactor, which breaks them apart resulting in the vapors generation.</li>
