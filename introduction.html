            <p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a term for electronic products that have become unwanted, non-working or obsolete, and have essentially reached the end of their useful life. Because technology advances at such a high rate, many electronic devices become “trash” after a few short years of use. In fact, whole categories of old electronic items contribute to e-waste such as VCRs being replaced by DVD players, and DVD players being replaced by blu-ray players.<br> <br> <br> The problem with e-waste is that it often contains toxic chemicals (lead, mercury, cadmium, etc.) that are harmful to the environment. The improper disposal of e-waste results in environmental pollution as well as a potential threat to human health. The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) estimates that as much as 50 million tons of electronic waste are generated every year worldwide. The European Union is the largest producer of e-waste, with an estimated 12 million tons generated in 2005. The U.S. is the second largest producer, with approximately 3 million tons of e-waste generated in 2005.</p>
